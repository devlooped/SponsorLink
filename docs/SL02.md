# SL02: Missing SponsorLink App Installation

A package you installed uses SponsorLink to properly attribute your sponsorship with 
the project author(s), but the  [SponsorLink GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sponsorlink) is not installed on your personal account.

## Solution

In order to verify sponsorships, the personal GitHub account 
associated with your (locally configured) git email for the current project needs 
to install the [SponsorLink GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sponsorlink).

You can verify the email account you are currently using by running the following 
command from your project directory: `git config --get user.email`.

This email *must* match one of your verified emails on [your profile](https://github.com/settings/emails).

> NOTE: non-verified emails are not considered for matching, to prevent email 
> reuse or sharing.

The app *must* be installed on your personal account, *not* an organization 
account. At the moment, we do not support SponsorLink attribution at the 
organization level.

At installation time, the app will request your permission to access your account 
email addresses, so the installation can be linked to your account through your email(s).

You can suspend or uninstall the app at any point, but doing so will clear the 
email > installation mapping, so this warning will come back (typically within seconds).
