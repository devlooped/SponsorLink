# SL03: Missing Sponsorship

The [SponsorLink GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sponsorlink) is properly 
installed and active, but an active sponsorship couldn't be found for the 
sponsorable account of the library author.

The warning will contain the link of the sponsor's page to start your 
sponsorship. It looks like `https://github.com/sponsors/[SPONSORABLE]`.

## Solution

Once you start your sponsorship, within seconds the warning should go away. 
You can perform a rebuild to force a re-check.

Sponsorships do not need to be recurring, but at expiration time (30 days 
for one-time sponsorships) will cease to be active and this warning will 
reappear.

Cancelling recurring sponsorships doesn't happen immediately either, expiring 
at the end of the billing period. At that time, this warning will also 
reappear.
