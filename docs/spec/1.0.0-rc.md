# SponsorLink Manifest Version 1.0

## Overview

The SponsorLink manifest is a JWT (JSON Web Token) that encapsulates a user' sponsorship relationship 
with another user or organization. 

This manifest can be utilized to enable features exclusive to sponsors or to suppress requests for 
sponsorships by the author's code.

During regular usage of a SponsorLink-enabled tool or library, the author might perform an offline 
check to verify the user's sponsorship status before enabling a feature or suppressing build warnings.

This check is performed by reading the manifest from a well-known location in the user's environment 
and verifying its contents and signature.

Users can subsequently request a manifest to a backend service provided by the author so that 
subsequent checks can succeed. 

## Purpose

Establishing a standard method to represent and verify sponsorships in a secure, offline, and 
privacy-conscious manner would be advantageous for both open-source software (OSS) authors and users.

## Terminology

The term "sponsor" refers to the user or organization that is providing financial support 
to another user or organization.

The term "sponsorable" refers to the user or organization that is receiving financial 
support from another user or organization.

## Manifest Structure

A SponsorLink manifest is a (typically signed) JWT containing the following claims:

| Claim     | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `iss`     | The token issuer, typically the backend API URL |
| `aud`     | The sponsorable account |
| `sub`     | The sponsor account (e.g., GitHub login) |
| `email`   | The **optional** sponsor's email account(s) |
| `sponsor` | One of `user`, `organization` or `contributor` |
| `exp`     | The token's expiration date |

The `sponsor` claims can be used to distinguish between different types of sponsorships. 

* `user`: The sponsor is personally sponsoring.
* `organization`: The user belongs to at least one organization that is sponsoring.
* `contributor`: The user is a contributor and is therefore considered a sponsor.

For example, given:

- An organization `acme` that is sponsoring another organization `devlooped`.
- A user `alice` who is a member of the organization `acme`.
- `alice` requests from `devlooped` a SponsorLink token to access a feature.

A backend API provided by `devlooped` might issue a token with the following claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://api.devlooped.com",
  "aud": "devlooped",
  "sub": "alice",
  "email": [
    "alice@gmail.com",
    "alice@acme.com"
  ],
  "sponsor": "organization",
  "exp": 1696118400
}
```

### Token Signing

The token issuing backend provided by the author would typically sign the JWT using a private key. 
The corresponding public key would used by his libraries and tools to verify the manifest's signature 
and expiration date.

## Manifest Usage

Various sponsorship platforms can provide reference implementations of the backend service to issue
SponsorLink manifests using their platform's APIs. For example, GitHub, Open Collective, and Patreon 
could all provide such services. Either for self-hosting by authors or as a managed service.

A client-side tool would be provided for users to synchronize their SponsorLink manifest with the
backend service. This tool would typically require the user to authenticate with the platform and 
authorize the backend service to access their sponsorship information. This step would be explicit 
and require the user's consent to sharing their sponsorship information.

Manifests are stored at `~/.sponsorlink/[platform]/[sponsorable].jwt`, such as 
`~/.sponsorlink/github/devlooped.jwt`.

The author's code can check for the manifest presence and verify its contents and signature, which 
could enable or disable features, suppress build warnings, or provide other benefits to sponsors.
The author can optionally perform a local-only offline check to ensure the user's email address 
in the manifest matches the one in his local source repository configuration. 

The author may also choose to verify the token's expiration date, decide on a grace period, and 
issue a notification if the manifest is expired.

## Privacy Considerations

* The method of user identification for manifest generation is entirely determined by the issuer.
* The method of user identification for manifest consumption is left to the discretion of the tool 
  or library author. 
  
Once a manifest is generated in a user-explicit manner and with their consent, and stored in their 
environment, it can be utilized by any tool or library to locally verify sponsorships without any 
further network access.

At the author's discretion, a user identifier can be used to further ensure the manifest is applicable 
to the active user. One commonly used identifier is the user's email address, which is usually accessible 
via a `git` repository configuration. If the email is used, at the time of manifest generation, the 
user would be required to consent to sharing their email address with the backend service.
