This package is typically installed automatically as a transitive dependency from packages 
that leverage [SponsorLink](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink).

Some package authoring errors might cause this dependency to not be properly installed, 
so installing it directly on your projets failing with build errors `DSL00x` should fix 
the issues.

The goal of SponsorLink is to help make projects more sustainable, support their 
ongoing development and ensure you can depend on them in the long run!
