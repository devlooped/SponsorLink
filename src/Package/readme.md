Integrate [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) into your libraries so that 
users can be properly linked to their sponsorship to unlock features or simply get 
the recognition they deserve for supporting your project.

SponsorLink for .NET allows you to integrate sponsorship checks in the build process 
itself, without affecting IDE/Editor performance or command line/CI builds. Read 
more about [SponsorLink for open source developers](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink#-open-source-developers) 
and the onboarding process.

## Usage

Add the following generator to an analyzer project you include in your package:

```csharp
using Devlooped;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;

namespace SponsorableLib;

[Generator]
public class Generator : IIncrementalGenerator
{
    readonly SponsorLink link;

    public Generator() 
        => link = new SponsorLink("[SPONSORABLE]", "[PROJECT]");

    public void Initialize(IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext context)
        => link.Initialize(context);
}
```

Replace `SPONSORABLE` with your sponsor account login and `PROJECT` with a recognizable 
name of your project or library (i.e. `ThisAssembly` or `Moq`).

Make sure you have installed the [SponsorLink Admin](https://github.com/apps/sponsorlink-admin) app 
and have followed the [onboarding steps](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink#-open-source-developers).

We recommend using [NuGetizer](https://nuget.org/packages/nugetizer) for packing your 
libraries, which provides the easiest integration with SponsorLink too. Simply add
a project reference from your main library to the analyzer project and all packaging should 
Just Workï¿½. An example analyzer project referenced by your main library is typically just:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackFolder>analyzers/dotnet</PackFolder>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="NuGetizer" Version="0.9.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp" Version="4.3.1" Pack="false" />
    <PackageReference Include="Devlooped.SponsorLink" Version="0.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```


## How it works

When you ship a new version of your library including the above analyzer/generator assembly, 
at build time (this is done incrementally, so it won't happen on every build, but only whenever 
the project file changes, or on rebuilds), users will get one of these three messages:

1. User does not have the [GitHub SponsorLink](https://github.com/apps/sponsorlink) (user) 
   app installed in his personal account. [Warning SL02](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink/blob/main/docs/SL02.md):

2. User installed the app, but is not sponsoring the sponsorable account. 
   [Warning SL03](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink/blob/main/docs/SL03.md):

3. User installed the app and is sponsoring:

The goal of SponsorLink is to help make your project more sustainable, support your 
ongoing development and ensure your customers can depend on it in the long run!
